    it takes to live life as an adventurer?

    attacked, losing, etc.

    their choices for the path they choose by clicking the choice the 
    1appears on the screen. There will also be a section for the 
    previous choices and events that the player can click on to go to.

The controls for this game are straight forward once you know them 
    so the first choice will tell the player how to play.

    considered a dangerous option within the choices and avoid picking 
    them whenever possible. There will be multiple ways to beat the 
    game so there is not a set path that is needed to follow.
